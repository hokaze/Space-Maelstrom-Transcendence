# v0.47 #
Updated help_popup to include powerups and vortexes. Formerly unused pew4 now used for powerup collection.
Increased difficulty:
- decreased B3_COOLDOWN from 60 to 45, increased E1_ATTACK from 5 to 15
- increased AS1_MAX from 20 to 25, E1_MAX from 10 to 12, V1_MAX from 3 to 5
- decreased chance of powerup spawn from 1/4 to 1/8
Window title goes from "Loading..." to "Space Maelstrom Transcendence" when menu is ready.

# v0.46 #
Added powerups in 4 types: +20 HP, -2 B1 cooldown, -4 B2 cooldown, +1000 points.
Powerups only collide with players, no other objects, randomly spawned upon enemy death by any cause.
Non-score powerups have limits, if an attribute is maxed out you gain points instead.
Can no longer die or apply highscore in debug mode (so no cheating!)

# v0.45 #
Added animated vortex obstacle: cannot be destroyed, does constant damage on collision, eats bullets, asteroids, debris, enemies
Simplified set_clips function (used by ship and vortex), added forced wait on highscore display upon death

# v0.44 #
Highscores now save to file, slight tweaks to asteroid and enemy spawn area, elimination of some magic numbers.
Loop now works so that you can exit the game (with ESC or death) and return to the menu. Somewhat buggy.
Bug: there's still something destroying objects invisibly in the bottom left of the screen sometimes.

# v0.43 #
Death condition added (outside debug mode) with death splash, then high score table.
Start of high score entry system: checks if score is higher than any current high scores, lets user enter name.
Highscores are now bubble sorted based on score, with pos added based on array position.

# v0.42 #
All bugs with F1 help in-game seem to be fixed.
Added high score display and sounds to menu. Because of input bug, sounds may play twice
Basic declaration of ownership added.

# v0.41 #
Modification to Ship::handle_input() fixes movement bug with pressing F1 in-game.
SDL_PollEvent now uses if instead of while as we're already in a while loop, may provide slight performance boost.
Bullet cooldown on b1 and b2 now use player_ship values, eliminating need for global int.
SDL key event problem where keys are registered twice not fixed.

# v0.40 #
Help popup impemented on main menu and in-game (F1)

# v0.39 #
Very primitive highscore placeholder code, tweaked sound effects (mostly made quieter, faster)
Added remix of bgm (for future boss fight maybe?)
Added title screen graphics, primitive title screen

# v0.38 #
Code cleanup: set_clips() now part of my_ship, my_ship renamed player_ship, created update_bg() function and the Background struct to simplify Main slightly.
player_ship score and hp made private, new functions for update/access.
Debris collisions with player, asteroids and bullets implemented (damage, score, etc), debris has no hp of its own, it's effectively 1 HP.

# v0.37 #
Enemies now show an explosion sprite for 0.25 seconds after death.
Updated win32, linux32 and linux64 builds.

# v0.36 #
Objects now can be damaged and have their own attack values rather than dying after single hits or modifying player hp directly.
Collisions between player and enemy ships implemented.
Objects now know what sprite represents them, no need to remind them on every .show() call anymore.
Faster diagonal movement feature/bug fixed, diagonal movement is now the same as a single direction rather than 2x speed.

# v0.35 #
Added player weapon cooldown modifier keys (and updated HUD info on cooldowns) to DEBUG MODE.
Slight tweaks to player bullet array sizes, added currently unused explosion sprite.
Default FPS changed to 60, the faster pace feels smoother. May revert to 30 if later versions become too intensive for low-end hardware.

# v0.34 #
Noted: asteroids will still sometimes explode randomly without bullet collision, normally in the bottom-right.
CHANGELOG.txt added to git repo.

# v0.33 #
Tweaked debris generation to be slower, directed away from the player and inherit SOME asteroid inertia.
Vanishing debris bug at lower speeds is reduced but not entirely eliminated.
Stationary debris problem fixed.

# v0.32 #
Merged HUD update drawing functions together, now uses one surface.
linux32 and linux64 builds.

# v0.31 #
Added command line flag support.
DEBUG and FULLSCREEN modes now togglable on command line.

# v0.30 #
Updated HUD drawing functions to be slightly nicer.
Noted: earlier win32 memory leak does not occur on linux32 or linux64 builds even with fix applied.
New memory leak found that occurs at roughly the half-way point through BG scrolling fixed.
Added DEBUG MODE.

# v0.29 #
Some code cleanup, collisions with enemy bullets now implemented

# v0.28 #
Updated linux32, linux64 and raspberry builds.

# v0.27 #
Fixed memory leak on win32 as a result of TTF rendering. Uses a horrible hack with SDL_FreeSurface, is there a better way?

# v0.26 #
Added score system!
Enemies die fromy your bullets, asteroids/enemies grant points, added sound effect for enemy death (but no gfx yet)

# v0.25 #
Enemies now spawn and re-spawn like Asteroid objects. Spawn patterns tweaked to reduce clustering for both.
There appears to be a memory leak somewhere?

# v0.24 #
Enemy bullets now display and update correctly, slight rearrangement of enemy/bullet code.
Optimised win32 builds now use Release instead of Debug in VS.

# v0.23 #
Updated clean_up function to account for new surfaces and audio, should prevent memory leaks.
Updated win32 build. 

# v0.22 #
Updated win32 build, slight code tweaks.

# v0.21 #
First enemy in-game, no collisions between it, player, asteroids or bullets yet.
Enemy fires, makes its own firing noise but bullets don't display...?

# v0.20 #
Fixed rapid-fire bug.
Slight tweak to debris code.
Fixed earlier commit.

# v0.19 #
Added very basic debris generation upon asteroid destruction. Asteroids play break noise on destruction.
Updated linux32 and linux64 builds.

# v0.18 #
Collision detection bugs between bullets and asteroids fixed.
Updated win32 build.

# v0.16 #
New build supported: Raspberry Pi (ARM11 linux), builds for this platform WILL lag behind PC builds and aren't fully tested.

# v0.15 #
Fixed missing files on some commits.
Bullet code tweaked to fix some bugs, two bullet types implemented.
Multiple asteroids, have movement, some buggy collision with bullets and de/re-spawn.
Health system!

# v0.12 #
New sound effects added, mostly unused currently. LICENSE updated to include details for artistic assets.

# v0.11 #
New build supported: linux32 (x86), both x86 and x86_64 linux builds uploaded.

# v0.1 #
Added git repo, Simple Motion Test now used for first year C++ programming project, renamed Space Maelstrom Transcendence.
Added README.txt and LICENSE.txt. Unused artwork added.
Slight bullet tweaks, added sound effects.

# v0.05 #
Background scrolling tweaks, music playback solved (problem with DLLs on Windows release and some library path problems with Visual Studio).
Primitive bullet added, buggy but fires.

# v0.04 #
Some code cleanup, background scrolling split into layers, ogg music added with SDL_mixer. Works on Linux, not on Windows?

# v0.03 #
First large scrolling background implemented.

# v0.02 #
Player movement is constrained vertically and wraps horizonatally. Diagonal speed bug deemed a feature.

# v0.01 #
Simple Motion Test file made, draws a simple background to screen and a movable player sprite. A hackspace of sorts to learn SDL in and nothing more.
