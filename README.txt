### SMT ###
SMT or Space Maelstrom Transcendence, is a simple sh'mup game developed in C++ and SDL, as a 1st year programming project.
The objective is to simply stay alive and earn as many points as possible, upgrading your ship along the way.
Will eventually be open-sourced fully and licensed under the MIT License.

The name "SMT" is derived from how the code started out, as a practice "Simple Motion Test" to learn the SDL library and its extensions.
It may not yet be a truly playable game, but needless to say, SMT has gone beyond its original name.
