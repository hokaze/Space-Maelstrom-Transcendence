## Libraries ##

# SDL #

Please distribute this file with the SDL runtime environment:

The Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL for short) is a cross-platfrom library
designed to make it easy to write multi-media software, such as games and
emulators.

The Simple DirectMedia Layer library source code is available from:
http://www.libsdl.org/

This library is distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPL license:
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html


# SDL ttf #

This library is a wrapper around the excellent FreeType 2.0 library,
available at:
	http://www.freetype.org/

This library allows you to use TrueType fonts to render text in SDL
applications.

To make the library, first install the FreeType library, then type
'./configure' then 'make' to build the SDL truetype library and the
showfont and glfont example applications.

Be careful when including fonts with your application, as many of them
are copyrighted.  The Microsoft fonts, for example, are not freely 
redistributable and even the free "web" fonts they provide are only 
redistributable in their special executable installer form (May 1998).
There are plenty of freeware and shareware fonts available on the Internet
though, and may suit your purposes.

This library is under the zlib license, see the "ZLIB" section for details.

Enjoy!

# SDL image #

The latest version of this library is available from:
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

This is a simple library to load images of various formats as SDL surfaces.
This library supports BMP, PNM (PPM/PGM/PBM), XPM, LBM, PCX, GIF, JPEG, PNG,
TGA, and TIFF formats.

API:
#include "SDL_image.h"

	SDL_Surface *IMG_Load(const char *file);
or
	SDL_Surface *IMG_Load_RW(SDL_RWops *src, int freesrc);
or
	SDL_Surface *IMG_LoadTyped_RW(SDL_RWops *src, int freesrc, char *type);

where type is a string specifying the format (i.e. "PNG" or "pcx").
Note that IMG_Load_RW cannot load TGA images.

To create a surface from an XPM image included in C source, use:

	SDL_Surface *IMG_ReadXPMFromArray(char **xpm);

An example program 'showimage' is included, with source in showimage.c

JPEG support requires the JPEG library: http://www.ijg.org/
PNG support requires the PNG library: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
    and the Zlib library: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
TIFF support requires the TIFF library: ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/

If you have these libraries installed in non-standard places, you can
try adding those paths to the configure script, e.g.
sh ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/somewhere/include" LDFLAGS="-L/somewhere/lib"
If this works, you may need to add /somewhere/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
so shared library loading works correctly.

This library is under the zlib License, see the "ZLIB" section for details.


# SDL mixer #

The latest version of this library is available from:
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

Due to popular demand, here is a simple multi-channel audio mixer.
It supports 8 channels of 16 bit stereo audio, plus a single channel
of music, mixed by the popular MikMod MOD, Timidity MIDI and SMPEG MP3
libraries.

See the header file SDL_mixer.h and the examples playwave.c and playmus.c
for documentation on this mixer library.

The mixer can currently load Microsoft WAVE files and Creative Labs VOC
files as audio samples, and can load MIDI files via Timidity and the
following music formats via MikMod:  .MOD .S3M .IT .XM. It can load
Ogg Vorbis streams as music if built with Ogg Vorbis or Tremor libraries,
and finally it can load MP3 music using the SMPEG or libmad libraries.

Tremor decoding is disabled by default; you can enable it by passing
	--enable-music-ogg-tremor
to configure, or by defining OGG_MUSIC and OGG_USE_TREMOR.

libmad decoding is disabled by default; you can enable it by passing
	--enable-music-mp3-mad
to configure, or by defining MP3_MAD_MUSIC
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
WARNING: The license for libmad is GPL, which means that in order to
         use it your application must also be GPL!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The process of mixing MIDI files to wave output is very CPU intensive,
so if playing regular WAVE files sound great, but playing MIDI files
sound choppy, try using 8-bit audio, mono audio, or lower frequencies.

To play MIDI files, you'll need to get a complete set of GUS patches
from:
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/mixer/timidity/timidity.tar.gz
and unpack them in /usr/local/lib under UNIX, and C:\ under Win32.

This library is under the zlib license, see the "ZLIB" section for details.

# LGPL #

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented 
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an 
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library,
but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class
defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the
Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made
is also called the “Linked Version”.

The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source
for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work
that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked
Version.

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or
source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System
Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being
bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers
to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
the modified version:

•a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in
the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still
operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
•b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License
applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that
is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice,
provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters,
data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

•a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in
it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
•b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively
do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work
and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the
following:

•a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it
and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
•b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
•c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright
notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
•d) Do one of the following: 
•0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding
Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or
relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
Source.
•1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
•e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide
such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information
is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining
or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0,
the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding
Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner
specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single
library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by
this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of
the following:

•a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
•b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library,
and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that
a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it,
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU
Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
